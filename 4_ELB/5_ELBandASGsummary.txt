1. high availability vs scalability (vertical and horizontal) vs Elasticity vs Agility
in the cloud.

2. Elastic Load Balancers (ELB)
    -> distribute traffic across backend EC2 instances, can be multi AZ
    -> 4 types: classic(old) , application (HTTP - L7), Network (TCP - L4), Gateway (L3)

3. Auto scaling Groups
    -> implement Elasticity for your application, across multiple AZ.
    -> scale EC2 instances based on the demand of your system, replace unhealthy/
    -> integrated with the ELB.
