-> scalibility means that an application/system can handle greater loads by adapting.
-> two kinds of scalibility
1. vertical 2. horizontal scalibility

-> scalibility is linked but different to high availability...

-> vertical scalability
    -> vertical scalability means increasing the size of the instance.
    senior operator in place of junior operator in call center...
    -> vertical scalability is very common for non distributed systems, such as a database.
    -> there is a limit to how much you can vertically scale(hardware limit)...
    -> from t2.nano - 0.5G of RAM, I vCPU  TO u-12tbI.metal-12.3TB of RAM, 448 vCPUs..


-> horizontal scalability 
    -> means increasing the number of instances/systems for your application.
    -> implies distributed systems.
    -> very common for web applications/modern applications.
    -> it is easy to horizontally scale thanks the cloud offerings such as Amazon EC2.
    -> auto scaling group
    -> load balancer

-> High availability
    -> high availability usually goes in hand in hand with horizontal scaling.
    -> means running your application/system in at least 2 availability zones.
    -> the goal of high availability is to survive a data center loss(disaster)...
    -> auto scaling Group multi AZ
    -> Load balancer multi AZ


1. scalibility -> ability to accomodate a larger load by making the hardware stronger (scale up)
or by adding nodes.

2. Elasticity -> once a system is scalable, Elasticity means that there will be some 
"auto-scaling" so that the system can scale based on the load. This is cloud friendly:
pay-per-use , match demand, optimize costs.

3. agility -> (not related to scalibility - distractor) -> new IT resources are only a click away, 
which means that you reduce the time to make those resources available to your developers 
from weeks to just minutes..
