----- s3 transfer Acceleration ----------
-> increase transfer speed by transferring file to an AWS edge location which wll forward 
the data to the S3 bucket in the target region.


----- aws global accelerator -------

-> improve global application availability and performance using the AWS global network.
-> leverage the AWS internal network to optimize the route to your application (60 % improvement)

-> 2 anycast IP are created for your application and traffic is sent through edge locations.
-> the edge locations send the traffic to your application.

--- AWS global accelerator vs cloudFront ---------

-> they both use the AWS global network and its edge locations around the world.
-> both services integrate with AWS shield for DDoS protection.

-> cloudFront -> content Delivery Network
    -> improves performance for your cacheable content (such as images and videos)
    -> content is served at the edge.

-> global accelerator 
    -> no caching, proxying packets at the edge to applications running in one or more AWS regions.
    -> improves performance for a wide range of applications over tcp or udp 
    -> good for HTTP use cases that require static iP addresses.
    -> good for HTTP use cases that required deterministic, fast regional failover.

---- AWS wavelength -------

-> wavelength zones are infrastructure deployments embedded within the telecommunications 
providers datacenters at the edge of the 5g network.

-> brings AWS services to the edge of the 5g network.
-> example: EC2, EBS, VPC....

-> ultra-low latency applications through 5G networks
-> traffic doesn't leave the communication service provider's (CSP) network.
-> high bandwidth and secure connection to the parent AWS region.
-> no additional charges or service agreements.
-> use cases: smart cities, ML-assisted diagnostics, connected vehicles, interactive live 
video streams, AR/VR, Real-time Gaming...

------ AWS Local Zones -------

-> places AWS compute, storage, database, and other selected AWS services closer to end 
users to run latency-sensitive applications.

-> extend your VPC to more locations - "extension of an AWS region"
-> compatible with EC2, RDS, ECS, EBS, ElasiCache, Direct Connect...

example:
    -> AWS region: N. virginia (US-east-1)
    -> AWS local Zones: Boston, chicago, Dallas, Houston, Miami....


-------- global Application architecture (1 ques) -------------

case1 -> single region, single AZ   
    -> high availability (N)
    -> global latency (N)
    -> difficulty (Y)

case2 -> single region, multi AZ
    -> high availability (Y)
    -> global latency (N)
    -> difficulty (moderate)

case3 -> multi region, active-passive
    -> active instance mai read/write dono hoga.
    -> passive instance mai aapka read only...
    -> global readers latency (improved)
    -> global writers latency (not su much improved)
    -> difficulty (moderate)

case 4 -> multi region, active-active
    -> likho padho aaram se...
    -> difficulty (jyada)
