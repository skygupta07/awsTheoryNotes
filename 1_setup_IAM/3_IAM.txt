IAM -> identity and access management

actually our root account has too much pemissions and access, so now to restrict this...
we create IAM account like for admin for public/user...

using IAM I can restrict permissions to a user....
jaisi hi mene user ki permission delete kari ... udhar user ko turant changes reflect ho gaye honge...

creating groups example -> developers , operations team
-> users of groups can be assigned JSON documents called policies
-> we follow least privilege scheme -> i.e allowing least access to end user as much as possible..

-> IAM is a global service

admin user group banaya jisme akash naam ka user banaya jissey ki admin bana diya aur 
uski access power defined kar di....

dashboard mai jaake account alias banaya 

IAM policies structure dekhne ko milega... version id statement

version -> 2012-10-17
id -> identifier for the policy
statement -> one or more individual statements

statements consists of ->
1. Sid -> an identifier for the statement
2. Effect -> whether the statement allows or denies access
3. principal -> account/role/user to which this policy applied to..
4. action -> list of actions this policy allows or denies
5. Resource -> list of resources to which the action applied to
6. condition -> when this policy is in effect (optional)
