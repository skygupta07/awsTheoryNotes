-> highly-secure, portable devices to collect and process data at the edge, and migrate data
into and out of AWS.

-> Data migration
    1. snowcone, 2. snowball edge   3. snowmobile

-> Edge computing
    -> snowcone -> snowball Edge

----- data migration with AWS snow Family ---------

challenges:
    1. Limited connectivity
    2. Limited Bandwidth
    3. High Network cost
    4. shared Bandwidth (can't maximize the line)
    5. connection stability

-> AWS snow family : offline devices to perform data migrations.
    -> If it takes more than a week to transfer over the network over the network use, 
    use snowball devices!

--

-> direct upload to s3
or snowball use kiya yaha kind of pendrive mai apna saaman daal ke courier kar diya 
amazon ko and unhone waha taar laga ke fast fast apne mai store kar liya..

----snowball Edge (for data transfer) -----
-> physical data transport solution: move TBs or PBs of data in or out of AWS.
-> alternative to moving data over the network (and paying network fees)
-> pay per data transfer job
-> provide block storage and Amazon s3-compatible object storage.

-> snowball edge storage optimized 
    -> 80 TB of HDD capacity for block volume and s3 compatible object storage.

-> snowball edge compute optimized
    -> 42 TB of HDD or 28TB NVMe capacity for block volume and s3 compatible object storage.

    -> use cases : large data cloud migrations, DC decommision, disaster recovery.


-> snowcone and snowcone SSD
    -> small, portable, computin anywhere ,rugged and secure, withstands harsh environments.
    -> lightweight (4.5 pound, 2.1 kg)
    -> device used for edge computing , storage, and data transfer
    -> snowcone - 8 TB of HDD storage
    -> snowcone SSD - 14 TB of SSD storage
    -> use snowcone where snowball doesn't fit(space mai NASA wale)
    -> must provide your own battery/cables.
    -> can be sent back to AWS offline, or connect it to internet and use AWS Datasync to send data.

    -> 2 CPUs, 4 GB of memory, wired or wireless access
    -> USB-C power using a cord or the optional battery.




--> AWS snowmobile  (ek bada sa truck aayega aap se data lene)
    -> Transfer exabytes of data (1 EB = 1,000 PB = 1,000,000 TBs)
    -> Each snowmobile has 100 PB of capacity (use multiple in parallel)
    -> High Security: temperature controlled, GPS, 24/7 video surveillance
    -> better than snowball if you transfer more than 10 PB.

------ snow Family --- usage Process ----
1. request snowball devices from the AWS console for delivery
2. intall the snowball client/AWS OpsHub on your servers.
3. connect the snowball to your servers and copy files using the client.
4. ship back the device when you are done (goes to the right AWS facility)
5. Data will be loaded into an S3 bucket.
6. snowball is completely wiped.



--------- Edge computing ---------

-> process data while it's being created on an edge location.
    -> A truck on the road, a ship on the sea, a mining station underground.

-> These locations may have: 
    -> limited/ no internet access.
    -> Limited/no easy access to computing power

-> we setup a snowball Edge/ snowcone device to do edge computing 

-> use cases :->
    -> preprocess data.
    -> machine learning at the edge.
    -> Transcoding media streams.

-> eventually (if need be) we can ship back the device to AWS (for transferring data for example)


------ snowball Edge - compute optimized ------
    -> 104 vCPUs, 416 GiB of RAM
    -> Optional GPU (useful for video processing or machine Learning)
    -> 28 TB NVMe or 42TB HDD usable storage.
    -> storage clustering Available (upto 16 nodes)


------- snowball edge ----- storage optimized ------
    -> upto 40 vCPUs, 80 GiB of RAM, 80 TB storage.

-> All : can run EC2 instances and AWS Lambda funcitons (using AWS IoT greengrass)

-> Long term deployment options: 1 and 3 years discounted pricing..


----- AWS OpsHub --------

-> historically, to use Snow Family devices, you needed a CLI (command Line Interface tool)
-> Today, you can use AWS OpsHub (a software you can install on your computer/laptop)
to manage your snowfamily Device.
    -> unlocking and configuring single or clustered devices
    -> Transferring files
    -> Launching and managing instances running on snow Family Devices
    -> Monitor device metrices (Storage capacity, active instances on your device)

    -> Launch compatible AWS services on your devices (eg. Amazon EC2 instances, AWS data sync,
    Network File system (NFS)).
