types of storage classes->

1. amazon S3 standard -> general purpose 
    -> 99.99 % Availability
    -> used for frequently accesssed data
    -> low latency and high throughput
    -> sustain 2 concurrent facility failures.

    use cases -> Big data analytics, mobile and gaming applications, content distribution.


2. amazon s3 standard -> infrequent access (IA)
    -> for data that is less frequently accesssed, but requires rapid access when needed
    -> lower cost than needed.
    -> 99.9% Availability
    -> use cases: disaster recovery, backups



3. amazon s3 one Zone-infrequent Access
    -> high durability (99.999999999 % nine times nine) in a single digit AZ;
    data lost when AZ is destroyed
    -> 99.5% Availability 
    -> use cases : storing secondary backup copies of on-premise data, or data you can recreate.


4. amazon s3 Glacier Instant Retrieval
    -> low cost object storage meant for archiving/backup.
    -> pricing: price for storage + object retrieval cost

    -> millisecond retrieval, great for data accessed once a quarter.
    -> minimum storage duration of 90 days.


5. amazon s3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval (formerly Amazon S3 Glacier)
    -> Expedited (1 to 5 minutes), standard (3 to 5 hours), Bulk (5 to 12 hours) - free
    -> minimum storage duration of 90 days.


6. amazon s3 Glacier Deep Archive 
    -> standard(12 hours) , bulk (48 hours)
    -> minimum storage duration of 180 days.




7. amazon s3 Intelligent Tiering
    -> small monthly monitoring and auto-tiering fee
    -> moves objects automatically between Access Tiers based on usage.
    -> there are no retrieval charges in s3 Intelligent-Tiering

    --> frequent Access tier (automatic) : default tier
    --> infrequent Access tier (automatic) : objects not accessed for 30 days
    --> archive instant access tier (automatic) : objects not accessed for 90 days
    --> Archive access tier (optional) : configurable from 90 days to 700+ days
    --> deep Archive Access tier (optional) : config. from 180 days to 700 days+




-> can move between classes manually or using s3 lifecycle configurations.

----s3 durability and Availability ---------

-> durability 
    -> high durability (99.99999999999% 11 times 9) of objects across multiple AZ 
    -> If you store 10,000,000 objects with amazon s3, you can on average expect to incur
    a loss of a single object once every 10,000 years.
    -> same for all storage classes.

-> Availability 
    -> measures how readily Available a service is 
    -> varies depending on storage class
    -> Example : s3 standard has 99.99 % Availability = not Available 53 minutes a year



--- storage classes ki lifecycle bhi decide kar sakte ho .... ki aapka itne din mai..
iss wale storage class se iss wale storage class mai shift ho jaye....

-> bucket ki properties mai jaake storage class wali settings theek kari...


--- s3 Encryption -------

sever side pe encryption hoga...(server encrypts the file after receiving it)
-> client side encryption (user encrypts the file before uploading it)

-----shared responsibility model for S3 ----

---->aws ki responsibility 
    1. infrastructure , configuration, compliance validation

-----> user ki responsibility
    -> s3 versioning, s3 bucket policy, s3 replication setup 
    -> logging and monitoring , s3 storage classes
    -> data encryption at rest and in transit..
