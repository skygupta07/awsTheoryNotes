just like drive, object storage in bucket 
data as objects. 

s3 -> bucket -> folder -> object -> public access 
-------

go to your desired region
create bucket
    standard options tick
    bucket name unique
    enable versioning

upload and see things (would not be publicly available)
go to permissions 
    acl enable
    make public => unblock all 

actions mai jaake acl -> enable and then everyone ko read ki permission de di....
