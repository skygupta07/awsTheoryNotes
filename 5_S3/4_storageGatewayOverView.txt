---- hybrid cloud for storage -------

-> AWS is pushin for "hybrid cloud"
    -> part of your infrastructure is on-premises 
    -> part of your infrastructure is on the cloud.

-> This can be due to : 
    -> long cloud migrations
    -> security requirements
    -> compliance requirements
    -> IT strategy

s3 data on premise?

-> AWS storage gateway
    -> bridge between on premise data and cloud data in S3. 
    -> files , volumes, Tapes aur   Amazon EBS, s3, Glacier ke beech mai bridge ki tarah act karta hai..aapka storage gateway...
