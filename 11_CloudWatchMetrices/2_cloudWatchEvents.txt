-------- amazon event bridge formerly cloudWatch Events-------
-> schedule : cron jobs (scheduled scripts)
      -> schedyle every hour that trigger script on lambda function

-> event pattern: event rules to react ot a service doing something
    -> matalb in case root user signin karta hai to SNS ke through email notification send karwa do...

-> trigger Lambda functions, send SQS/SNS messages.

aws services -> default event bus se linked
aws saas partners zendesk DAtadog -> partner event BUS ke linked 
custom apps -> custom event BUS se linked
-> schema Registry : model event schema.
-> you can archive events(all/filter) sent to an event bus (indefinitely or set period)
-> ability to replay archived events.



----- AWS cloudTrail ------------

-> povides governance , compliacne and audit fro your aws account
-> cloudTrail is enabled by default 
-> get an history of events/API calls made within your AWS account by:
     -> console -> sdk -< cli -> aws services 
-> can put logs form cloudTrail into cloudWatch logs or s3
-> a trail can be applied to all regions (default) or a single region.
-> if a resource is deleted in AWS, investigate cloudTRail first.



--------- AWS x-RAy ---------------------

-> debugging in production, the good old way:
     -> test locally -> add log statements everywhere -> re-deploy in production 

-> log formats differ across applications and log analysis is hard.
-> debugging: one big monolith 'easy' , distributed services 'hard'

x-ray gives visual analysis of our application.

=> advantages 
     -> troubleshooting performance (bottlenecks)
      -> understand dependencies in a microservice architecture
      -> pinpoint service issues.
      -> review request behaviour
      -> find errors and exceptions
     -> are we meerting time SLA?
     -> where I am throttled?
      -> identify users that are impacted.

--- amazon CodeGuru ----------- 

-> an ML-powered service for automated code reviews and application performance recommendations.
-> provides two functionalities
    1. codeGuru Reviewer: automated code reviews for static code analysis (development)
    2. codeGuru Profiler: visiblilty/recommendations about application performance during runtime (production)

------- amazon code guru Reviewer --------
-> identify critical issues, security vulnerabilities, and hard to find buds.
-> example: common coding best practices, resource leaks, security detection, input validation.
-> uses machine learning and automated reasoning.
-> hard-learned lessons across millions of code reviews on 1000s of open-source and amazon repositories.
-> supports java and python.
-> integrates with Github, bitbucket, and AWS CodeCommit.


----- Amazon CodeGuru Profiler --------
-> helps understand the runtime behaviour of your application.
-> example: identify if your application is consuming excessive cpu capacity on a logging routine.
-> features:
     -> identify and remove code inefficinecs.
    -> improve application perfomance
     -> decrease compute costs.
     -> provides heap summary (identify which objects using up memory)
     -> anomaly detection.

-> support applications running on AWS or on-premise.
-> minimal overhead on application.


-------------- AWS Health DashBoard - service history ------------ 
-> shows all regions, all services health.
-> shows historical information for each day.
-> has an RSS feed you can subscribe to .
-> previously called aWS service health dashboard.

-------- AWS health Dashboard - your account -----------
-> previously called AWS personal Health Dashboard (PHD)
-> AWS account Health dashboard provides alerts, and remediation guidance when aws is experiencing events that may impact you.
-> while the service health dashboard displays the general status of AWS services, accout health dashboard gives you a personalized view into the performance and availabilty of the aws services underlying your aws resources.
-> the dashboard displays relevant and timely informaton to help you manage events in progress and provides proactive noriiaciton to help you plan for schduled activiteis.
-> can aggregate data from an entire AWS organizations.
 

-------- aws monitoring summary ----------- 
1. cloudWatch:
    -> metrices: monitor the performance of aws services and billing metrices.
    -> alarms: automate notification, perform EC2 action, notify to SNS based on metric.
    -> logs: collect log files from EC2 instances, servers, lambda functions.
     -> events (or eventBridge) : react to events in AWS, or trigger a rule on a schedule.

2. cloudTrail
    audit API calls made within your aws account.

3. cloud Trail Insights: automated analysis of your cloudTrail Events.
4. x-ray: trace requests made through your distributed applications.
5. aws health dashboard: status of all aws services across alll regions.
6. aws Account Health Dashboard: AWS events that impact your infrastructre.
7. amazon CodeGuru: automated code reviews and application perforamance recommendations.
