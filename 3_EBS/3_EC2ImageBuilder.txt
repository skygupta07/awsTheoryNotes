-> used to automate the creation of virtual machines or container images.
-> automate the creation, maintain , validate and test EC2 AMIs
can be run on a schedule (weekly, whenever packages are updated, etc...)
-> free service (only pay for the underlying resource)

-> EC2  image builder create builder EC2 instance which create new AMI which furher
creates test EC2 instance then AMI is distributed...

------ EC2 instance store -------
-> EBS volumes are network drives with good but "limited" performance.
-> if you need a high performance hardware disk , use EC2 instance store.
better I/O performance, 
-> EC2 instance store lose their storage if they are stopped (ephemeral)
-> good for buffer/cache/scratch data/temporary content
-> risk of data loss if hardware fails.
-> backups and replication are your responsibility.

==> local EC2 instance mai bada bada storage...
