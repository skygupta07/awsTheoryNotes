AMI = amazon machine image
-> AMI are a customization of an EC2 instance...
    -> you add your own software, configuration, operating system,monitoring..
    -> faster boot/configuration because all your software is pre-packaged.

-> AMIs are built for a specific region (and can be copied across regions)
-> you can launch EC2 instances from: 
    1. a public AMI: aws provided
    2. your own AMI: you make and maintain them yourself
    3. an AWS marketPlace AMI : an AMI someone else made (and potentially sells)

-> AMI process (from an EC2 instance)
    -> start an EC2 instance and customize it.
    -> stop the instance (for data integrity)
    -> build an AMI -> this will create EBS snapshots.
    -> launch instances from other AMIs

-> security group ko modify kiya and apache server wala pura code copy kiya bas last line 
chhod diya...
-> instance state AMI ki help se banaya....

-> network settings ko edit karke existing security group ko opt kiya...
-> phir neeche jaake advanced settings mai jaake user data ke neeche wale box mai wo
ramKahaani likhi mene....

-> instance create karne ke baad right click karke image and templates pe jaake -> create image kiya...
