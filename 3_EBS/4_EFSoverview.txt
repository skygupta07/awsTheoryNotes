EFS mai aapka ek file mai kucch rakha hai and another file mai kucch rakha hai...both
are accessible by single...

jabki EBS mai dusre ko access karwane ke liye... snapshot leke paste kiya...

EFS (Elastic file system)
-> managed NFS(network file system) that can be mounted on 100s of EC2.
-> EFS works with Linux EC2 instances in multi-AZ (availability zone)
-> highly available, scalable, expensive(3x gp2), pay per use, no capacity planning.

------- EFS-IA   infrequent access ------
-> storage class that is cost optimized for files not accessed every day...
-> upto 92% lower cost compared to EFS standard.
-> EFS will automatically move your files to EFS-IA based on the last time they 
were accessed.
-> EFS-IA with a lifecycle policy.
-> example : move files that are not accessed for 60 days to EFS-IA
-> transparent to the applications accessing EFS

------shared responsibility model for EC2 storage -------
aws ki responsibility :->
1. infrastructure
2. replication for data for EBS volumes and EFS drives.
3. replacing faulty hardware
4. ensuring their employees cannot access your data.

user ki responsibility :->
1. setting up backup/snapshot
2. setting up data encryption
3. responsibility of any data on the drives
4. understanding the risk of using EC2 instance store.


---- Amazon FSx overview -----
-> launch 3rd pary high-performance file systems on aws
-> fully managed service

example -> FSx for lustre , FSx for windows file server , FSX for NetApp ONTAP

    -> built on windows file server
    -> supports SMB protocol and windows NFTS
    -> integrated with microsoft active directory
    -> can be accessed from AWS or your on-premise infrastructure.

2. Amazon FSx for lustre
    -> a fully managed, high-performance, scalable file storage for High performance Computing (HPC)
    -> The name Lustre is derived from "Linux" and "cluster" 
    -> Machine Learning, Analytics, video processing, Financial Modeling...
    -> scales upto 100s GB/s , millions of IOPS, sub-ms latencies...
