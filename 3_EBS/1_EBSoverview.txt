an EBS (Elastic Block Store) volume is a network drive you can attach to your instances
while they run.

ELASTIC BLOCK STORE 


it allows your instances to persist data, even after their termination.
they can only be mounted to one instance at a time (at the ccp level).
-> the are bound to a specific availability zone.
-> Analogy : think of them as a "network USB stick"

free tier -> 30 GB of free EBS storage of type General Purpose (SSD) or magnetic per month.

---EBS volumes --------
-> it is a network drive (i.e. not a physical drive)
    . it uses the network to communicate the instance, which means there might be a bit of latency.
    . it can be detached from an EC2 instance and attached to another one quickly.

-> It's locked to availability zone (AZ)
    for example : an EBS volume in us-east-1 can't be attached to us-east-2.
    -> to move a volume across, you first need to snapshot it.

-> have a provisioned capacity (size in GBs and IOPS)

------ delete on termination attribute --------
-> controls the EBS behaviour when an EC2 instance terminates.
    . by default, the root EBS volume is deleted (attribute enabled)
    . by defalut, any other attached EBS volume is not deleted (attribute disabled)

however this can be controlled by the AWS console/ AWS CLI
-> use case: preserve root volume when instance is terminated.




-------EBS snapshots ---------
-> make a backup (snapshot) of your EBS volume at a point in time.
-> not necessary to detach volume to do snapshot, but recommended
-> can copy snapshots across AZ or region.

--EBS snapshots features =-===-------

1. EBS snapshot archive
    move a snapshot to an archive tier that is 75% cheaper.
    takes within 24 to 72 hours for restoring the archive.

2. Recycle bin for EBS snapshots
    -> setup rules to retain deleted snapshots so you can recover them after an accidental
    deletion.
    -> specify retention (from 1 day to 1 year)

-> ek jagah se snapshot leke dusri jagah rakh diya...basically volume ka data copy karke rakh
liya for easy copy and paste scenario...

snapshot se restore kar liya...
-> Recycle Bin helps to protect our amazon EBS snapshots and Amazon Machine Images(AMIs)
from accidental deletion...
