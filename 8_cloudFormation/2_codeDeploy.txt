------- codeDeploy ------

-> we want to deploy our application automatically.
-> works with EC2 instances.
-> works with on-premises servers.
-> hybrid service

-> servers/intances must be provisioned and configured ahead of time with the codeDeploy Agent.

----AWS ka code commit ----------

-> before pushing the application code to servers, it needs to be stored somewhere.
-> developers usually store code in a github, AWS competing product is codecommit.
-> codecommit
    -> source-control service that hosts git based Repository
    -> makes it easy to collaborate with others on code.
    -> the code changes are automatically versioned.

=> benefits: 
        -> fully managed.
        -> scalable and highly available.
        -> private, secured, integrated with AWS..


--------- codeBuild overview ----------

-> code building service in the cloud.
-> compiles source code , run tests, and produce packages that are ready to be deployed
(by codeDeploy) for example
-> benefits
    -> fully managed, serverless
    -> continuously , scalable and highly available.
    -> secure.
    -> pay as you go pricing - only pay for the build time.

-------- AWS code pipeline --------

-> orchestrate the different steps to have the code automatically pushed to production
    -> code -> build -> test -> provision -> deploy 
    -> basis for CICD (continuous integration and continuous delivery)

-> benefits: 
    -> fully managed, compatible with codecommit, codebuild, codeDeploy,Elastic Beanstalk,
    cloudFormation, github, 3rd party services (github...) and custom plugins.

    -> fast delivery and rapid updates.
    

------ AWS codeArtifact ------------
-> software packages depend on each other to be built (also called code dependencies)
, and new ones are created.
-> storing and retrieving these dependencies is called artifact management.
-> traditionally you need to setup your own artifact management system.
-> codeArtifact is a secure, scalable, and cost effective artifact management for software
develpment.
-> works with common dependency management tools such as Maven, Gradle, npm, yarn, twine,
pip and NuGet.
-> developers and codeBuild can then retrieve dependencies straight from codeArtifact.



----- AWS CodeStar (jhalmuri) -----------
-> unified UI to easily manage software development activities in one place.
-> "quick-way" to get started to correctly set-up codeCommit , codepipeline, codebuild,
codeDeploy, ElasticBeanStalk, EC2, etc.

-> can edit the code "in-the-cloud" using AWS Cloud9

------ AWS cloud9-------
-> AWS cloud9 is a cloud IDE (inegrated Development Environment) for writing, running
and debugging code.
-> "classic" IDE (like Intellij, visual studio code..)
are downloaded on a computer before being used.


-> A cloud IDE can be used within a web browser, meaning you can work on your projects from
your office, home or anywhere with internet with no setup necessary.


-> AWS cloud9 also allows for code collaboration in real-time (pair programming)

------- AWS systems Manager (SSM) -----------

-> helps you manage your EC2 and on-premises systems at scale.
-> another hybrid AWS service.
-> get operational insights about the state of your infrastructure.
-> suite of 10 + products.
-> most important features are: 
    -> patching automation for enhanced compliance.
    -> run commands across an entire fleet of servers.
    -> store parameter configuration with the SSM parameter store.

-> works for Linux, windows, MacOS and Raspberry pi OS (Raspbian)

------- how systems manage works ------

-> we need to install the SSM agent onto the systems onto the systems we control.
-> install by default on Amazon Linux AMI and some Ubuntu AMI..

-> if an instance can't be controlled with SSM , it's probably an issue with the 
SSM agent.

-> thanks to the SSM agent, we can run commands , patch and configure our servers.
