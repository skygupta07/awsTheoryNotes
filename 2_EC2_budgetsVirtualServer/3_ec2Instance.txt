we will launch our web server using EC2 user data
start/stop/terminate EC2 instances

ec2 instance ki public aur private do IPv4 banayi aws ne...
public ip ko google pe access kiya to ek website pe le gya jispe hello world likha aaya..
but dikha private ip address aa rha hai...
private waala direct nahi khul raha hai...


-> instance state mai jaake state ko stop kar diya...then phir website ka bhi gola ab infinite
loop mai ghoomta hi reh gaya....(infinite wait)

to get rid of instance you can terminate the instance also....
private ip will remain same ....while public ip may change on stopping and starting the instance again..
