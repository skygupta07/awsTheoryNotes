security groups (kind of firewall) are the fundamental of network security in AWS
they control how traffic is allowed into or out of our EC2 instances.

!!security group only contain allow rules!!. (ek haath se taali nahi bajti rule)
security groups rules can reference by IP or by security group..

 ==> outbound rule ko ched mat dena .....  (mahatma gandhi)



 
security groups are acting as firewall on EC2 instances
-> they regulate : 
1. access to ports 
2. authorised ip ranges - IPv4 and IPv6
3. * control of inbound network (from other to the instance)
4. control of outbound network (from the instance to other)

----- security groups --------
    -> can be attached to multiple instances
    -> locked down to a region/VPC combination
    -> does live "outside" the EC2 -> if traffic is blocked the EC2 instance won't see it.
    -> it is good to maintain one separate security group for SSH access
   imp -> if your application is not accessible (time out) then it's a security group issue.
    -> if your application gives a "connection refused" error, then it's an application error 
    or it's not launched...

A virtual private cloud (VPC) is an on-demand configurable pool of shared resources 
allocated within a public cloud environment, providing a certain level of isolation 
between the different organizations using the resources.


ALL INBOUND TRAFFIC IS BLOCKED BY DEFAULT
ALL OUTBOUND TRAFFIC IS authorised BY DEFAULT

search kucch bhi kar sakte ho... ab wo alag baat hai saamne wali website accessible 
hai ki nahi..

-------classic ports to know-----------

port 21 = FTP (file transfer protocol) -> upload files into a file share
port 22 = SSH(secure shell) -> log into a Linux instance
port 22 = SFTP (secure file transfer protocol) -> uploading files using SSH
port 80 = HTTP -> access unsecured websites (ye to bahut kiya hai tooplate.com wale se...)
port 443 = HTTPS -> access secured websites
port 3389 = RDP (Remote Desktop Protocol) -> log into a windows instance

0.0.0.0/0 -> access from anywhere

in case kabhi bhi EC2 instance mai timeout (infinite loop) wali issue aa jaye to aap simply
instance ki security group mai jaana and inbound rules edit karke dekho waha 1. ssh 2. http 

for sure hona chahiye ...agar nahi hai to create karo...
