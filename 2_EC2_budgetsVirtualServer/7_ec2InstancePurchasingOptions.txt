--EC2 instances Purchasing options------

1. on demand instances -> short workload, predicatable pricing, pay by second
    EC2 on demand 
    -> pay for whay you use:
        linux or windows - billing per second, after the first minute
        all other operatingSystems - billing per hour

    -> has the highest cost but no upfront payment.
    -> no long term commitment
    -> recommended for short-term and un-interrupted workloads, where you can't predict how 
    the application will behave..


2. Reserved (1 and 3 years)
    -> Reserved instances (instance type, region, tenancy, os)- long workloads
    -> convertible Reserved instances - long workloads with flexible instances
    -> upto 72 percent discount compared to on-demand
    -> reservation period -> 1 year(+discount) or 3years(+++ discount)
    -> payment options -> No upfront(+), partial upfront (++), all upfront(+++)
    reserved instance's scope -> regional or zonal 
    -> convertible reserved instances



3. Saving Plans (1 and 3 years) - commitment to an amount of usage, long workload.
    discount upto 72 percent
    -> commit to a certain type of usage ($10/hr for 1 or 3 years)
    -> usage beyond EC2 savings plans is billed at the On-demand price.

    -> locked to a specific instance family and AWS region (e.g. M5 in us-east-1)
    -> flexible across 
            -> instance size (e.g. m5.xlarge, m5.2xlarge)
            -> OS (e.g. Linux, windows)
            -> Tenancy (host, dedicated, default)

    


4. spot instances - short workloads, cheap, can lose instances(less reliable)
    can get a discount of upto 90 percent compared to ondemand
    -> instances that you can "lose" at any point of time if your max price is less than the current 
    spot price
    -> the most cost efficient instances in AWS

    -> useful for workloads that are resilient to failure
        batch jobs, data analysis, image processing, any distributed workloads, workloads
        with a flexible start and end time...




5. Dedicated hosts - book an entire physical server, control instance placement.
    -> a physical server with EC2 instance capacity fully dedicated to your use.
    -> allows you address compliance requirements and use your existing sever bound 
    software licenses (per-socket, per-core, per-VM software licenses)

    -> purchasing options: 
        on-demand -> pay per second for active dedicated host
        reserved -> 1 or 3 years (No upfront, partial upfront , all upfront)
    -> the most expensive option it is
    -> useful for software that have complicated licensing model (BYOL - Bring Your Own License)
    -> or for companies that have strong regulatory for compliance needs


6. dedicated instances - no other customers will share your hardware.
    -> instances run on hardware that's dedicated  to you.
    -> may share hardware with other instances in same account.
    -> no control over instance placement.

7. capacity Reservation - reserve capacity in a specific AZ for any duration...
    Reserve on Demand instances capacity in a specific AZ for any duration
    -> you always have access to EC2 capacity when you need it.
    -> no time commitment (create/cancel) anytime , no billing discounts
    -> combine with regional reserved instances and savings plan to benefit from billing 
    discounts.
    -> shot term, uninterrupted workloads that needs to be in a specific AZ

ANALOGY

    1. on demand -> coming an staying in resort whenever we like , we pay the full price (100)
    2. reserved -> like planning ahead and if we plan to stay for a long time, we may get a (7)
    good discount
    3. savings -> pay a certain amount per hour for certain period and stay in any room (6)
    type...sea facing
    4. spot instances -> the hotel allows people to bid for the empty rooms and the highest (4)
    bidder keeps the room, you can get kicked out at any time.
    5. dedicated hosts -> we book an entire building of the resort.
    6. capacity reservations -> you book a room for a period with full price even you don't stay in it.


 -- shared responsibility model for EC2 ---------

    1. aws responsibility 
    -> infrastructure (global network security)
    -> isolation on physical hosts
    -> replacing faulty hardware
    -> compliance validation

   2. user responsibility
    -> define security group rules
    -> operating system patches and updates 
    -> software and utilities installed on the EC2 instances
    -> IAM roles assigned to EC2 and IAM user access management
    -> data security on your instance.
