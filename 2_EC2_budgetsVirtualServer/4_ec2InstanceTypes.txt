-> aws naming convention   m5.2xlarge
m : instance class
5 : generation (AWS improves them over time)
2xlarge : size within the instance class

-> there are 7 types of instances
    G SCAM IMP 

1. general purpose 
    great for a diversity of workloads such as web servers or code repositories 
    -> balance between : compute memory networking
    -> we will be using t2.micro which is a general purpose EC2 instance...

2. compute optimised
    great for compute-intensive tasks that require high performance processors..
    -> batch processing workloads
    -> media transcoding
    -> high performance webservers
    -> high performance computing (hpc)
    -> scientific modelling and machine learning
    -> dedicated gaming servers
    example -> c5 , starting with c

3. memory optimised
    fast performance for workloads that process large data sets in memory
    use cases:
        high performance, relational/non-relational databases
        distributed web scale cache stores
        in memory databases optimized for BI (business Intelligence)
        applications performing real time processing of big unstructured data

4. accelerated computing

5. storage optimized
    
6. instance features

7. measuring instance performance

 example
 t2.micro instance provides vCPU(1) , Mem(1 GiB) storage (EBS only) Network performance(low to moderate)
 -- t2.micro is part of the AWS free tier (upto 750 hours per month)
