EC2 is one of the most popular of AWS offering , stands for Elastic Compute Cloud
EC2 knowledge is fundamental to understand how the cloud works... 
ec2 serves as iaas infrastructure as a service

it mainly consists in the capability of ->
1. renting virtual machines (EC2)
2. Storing data on virtual drives (EBS)
3. distributing load across machines (ELB)
4. scaling the services using an auto scaling group (ASG)

------EC2 sizing and configuration options -------
factors
1. operatingSystem: linux, windows, mac
2. how much compute power and cores(CPU) ,RAM, storage space needed?
3. network attached (EBS and EFS) , hardware (EC2 instances)
4. network card : speed of card, public IP address
firewall, bootstrap script (configure at first launch) : EC2 user data...

---------- EC2 user data ----

It is possible to bootstrap our instances using an EC2 user data script.
bootstraping means launching commands when a machine starts, that script is only run once at the
instance first start.
-> EC2 user data is used to automate boot tasks such as: 
    - installing updates
    - installing software
    - downloading common file from internet

EC2 instance types examples -> t2.micro (provided in amazon free tier), t2.xlarge, c5d.4xlarge, ....
for example in r5.16xlarge -> we get 64 (vCPU) , mem (512 GIB) , storage (EBS only), network performance (20 Gbps)
EBS bandwidth (13,600 Mbps)

---- creation of EC2 instance --------

1. choose an AMI
2. choose an instance type
3. configuring the instance
4. adding storage
5. adding tags.
6. configure security groups.
7. review
